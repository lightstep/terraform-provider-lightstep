# Lightstep Provider

In August 2023, [Lightstep became ServiceNow
Cloud Observability](https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/banner-faq). To ease the
transition, all code artifacts will continue to use the Lightstep name. You
don't need to do anything to keep using this provider.

The [Lightstep](https://lightstep.com) Provider is for Terraform to manage Lightstep-supported resources like dashboards or alerts.

## Example Usage

```
provider "lightstep" {
  api_key      = "Lightstep organization API key"
  organization = "Lightstep organization name"
}
```
