  Provides a Lightstep Role Binding https://api-docs.lightstep.com/reference/RoleBinding. Use this resource to manage users' roles in Lightstep. For conceptual information about managing users and roles, visit Lightstep's documentation https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/create-lightstep-users.
  You can assign users organization-level https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/roles-and-permissions#organization-roles or project-level https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/roles-and-permissions#project-roles roles. You can't assign users to a more restrictive project role than their organization role.
  NOTE: This Terraform resource is authoritative. If you don't declare a user in a Terraform resource, that user will lose any previously assigned roles in the specified organization and project.
  The valid organization roles are:
  * Organization Admin
  * Organization Editor
  * Organization Viewer
  * Organization Restricted Member
  The valid project roles are:
  * Project Editor
  * Project Viewer
  Changes to both organization- and project-level roles for the same user can cause race conditions.
  We suggest these changes be made in two steps.
  * When lowering a user's organization-level role and upping their project-level role, first change their organization role.
  * When upping a user's organization-level role and removing or lowering their project-level role, first change their project role.

# lightstep_user_role_binding (Resource)

Provides a [Lightstep Role Binding](https://api-docs.lightstep.com/reference/RoleBinding). Use this resource to manage users' roles in Lightstep. For conceptual information about managing users and roles, visit [Lightstep's documentation](https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/create-lightstep-users).

You can assign users [organization-level](https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/roles-and-permissions#organization-roles) or [project-level](https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/roles-and-permissions#project-roles) roles. You can't assign users to a more restrictive project role than their organization role.

**NOTE**: This Terraform resource is authoritative. If you don't declare a user in a Terraform resource, that user will lose any previously assigned roles in the specified organization and project. 

The valid organization roles are:
* Organization Admin
* Organization Editor
* Organization Viewer
* Organization Restricted Member


The valid project roles are:
* Project Editor
* Project Viewer


Changes to both organization- and project-level roles for the same user can cause race conditions. 
We suggest these changes be made in two steps. 
* When lowering a user's organization-level role and upping their project-level role, first change their organization role.
* When upping a user's organization-level role and removing or lowering their project-level role, first change their project role.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# The following example configures two users with the "Organization Restricted Member" role.
# It also overrides their permissions in "Project A", one with the "Project Editor" role and the other with the "Project Viewer" role.

# Set users to "Organization Restricted Member"
resource "lightstep_user_role_binding" "org_restricted" {
  role = "Organization Restricted Member"
  users = [
    "proj_a-editor@lightstep.com",
    "proj_a-viewer@lightstep.com"
  ]
}

# Set user "proj_a-editor@lightstep.com" to Project Editor in "Project A"
resource "lightstep_user_role_binding" "proj_editor" {
  project = "Project A"
  role    = "Project Editor"
  users = [
    "proj_a-editor@lightstep.com",
  ]
}

# Set user "proj_a-viewer@lightstep.com" to Project Viewer in "Project A"
resource "lightstep_user_role_binding" "proj_viewer" {
  project = "Project A"
  role    = "Project Viewer"
  users = [
    "proj_a-viewer@lightstep.com"
  ]
}
```
