  Provides a Lightstep Role Binding https://api-docs.lightstep.com/reference/cwronditions. This can be used to manage User's Organization level roles and Project level roles.
  A role binding can target either the Organization level roles or a Project role for a specific project. An user Project role can't be set to a more restrict role than their Organization level role.
  NOTE: this terraform resource is authoritative, users that are not declared in a terraform resource will lose the declared role in the specified organization/project.

  * Organization Editor
  * Organization Viewer
  The list of valid roles for Project level role bindings are:
  * Project Editor

# lightstep_user_role_binding (Resource)

Provides a [Lightstep Role Binding](https://api-docs.lightstep.com/reference/cwronditions). This can be used to manage User's Organization level roles and Project level roles.

A role binding can target either the Organization level roles or a Project role for a specific project. An user Project role can't be set to a more restrict role than their Organization level role. 

**NOTE**: this terraform resource is authoritative, users that are not declared in a terraform resource will lose the declared role in the specified organization/project.

The list of valid roles for Organization level role bindings are:
* Organization Admin
* Organization Editor
* Organization Viewer


The list of valid roles for Project level role bindings are:
* Project Editor
* Project Viewer


Changes to both Organization level role and Project level roles for the same user can cause race condition, 
in that case we suggest these changes to be made in two steps. 
* When lowering an user Organization level role and upping their Project level Role, first change their organization role.
* When upping an user Organization level role and removing or lowering their Project level Role, first change their project role.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# The following example shows how to configure two users with the "Organization Restricted Member" and
# override their permissions in "Project A", one with the "Project Editor" role and the other with the "Project Viewer" role.

# Set users to "Organization Restricted Member"
resource "lightstep_user_role_binding" "org_restricted" {
  role = "Organization Restricted Member"
  users = [
    "proj_a-editor@lightstep.com",
    "proj_a-viewer@lightstep.com"
  ]
}

# Set user "proj_a-editor@lightstep.com" to Project Editor in "Project A"
resource "lightstep_user_role_binding" "proj_editor" {
  project = "Project A"
  role    = "Project Editor"
  users = [
    "proj_a-editor@lightstep.com",
  ]
}

# Set user "proj_a-viewer@lightstep.com" to Project Viewer in "Project A"
resource "lightstep_user_role_binding" "proj_viewer" {
  project = "Project A"
  role    = "Project Viewer"
  users = [
    "proj_a-viewer@lightstep.com"
  ]
}
```
