  project_name = var.project
  name         = "database"
  description  = "Identifies select database management systems in the larger service topology"

  attribute_filters {
    key    = "span.kind"
    values = ["client"]
  }

  attribute_filters {
    key    = "db.type"
    values = ["sql", "redis", "memcached", "cassandra"]
  }
